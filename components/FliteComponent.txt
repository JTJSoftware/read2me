The Flite component is built with flite-1.3.5-current supplied by Allen Black
Flite xpcom component is developed by Jim Massey - massey@stlouis-shopper.com 

Flite component features:

flite-1.3.5-current is embedded in the libxpcomFlite.so component. There are 
some moddifications to the version of flite to make it compile in the mozilla 
framework and c++. I use the firefox build system to build the component, 
adding xpcom/Flite to the firefox build since I intend to release a ff3.x 
based kiosk browser with this incorporated(see kiosk.mozdev.org).

Currently only compiled for linux,tested on fc7 fc8, fc10 using ff3.x 
A windows build should be possible since flite should build there.

Four built-in Voices:
- kal  u.s. male
- slt  u.s female
- awb  u.s male
- rms  u.s male

It is best to use the Flite component from a seperate thread(ff3.x) because 
flite will block until it returns, this could be a long time if reading a 
large file.

Flite-1.3.5-current was slightly moddified so that speaking of long texts can 
be stopped, a stock flite-1.3.x will not return until finished processing. 
There is a global variable, stopSpeaking, that flite looks for. If 
stopSpeaking == 'stop' speaking will stop at end of current utterence.

Component use:
flite = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/Flite;1"].createInstance(Components.intefaces.nsIFlite);

//Test the component. This should say a line of text for each voice
flite.initFlite();

//Synth text file using default voice:
flite.sayFile('/path/to/file/file.txt");

//Synth text file using specified voice
flite.sayFileVoice("/path/to/file.txt", 'voice"); //voice can be rms slt awb kal

//Synth a text string using default voice
flite.sayThis("Some string of text to speak"); //using default voice

//Synth using specified voice
flite.sayThisVoice("Some text string", "voice"); // voice can be slt awb rms kal

//Stop Synth at end of current utterence chunk(actualy begining of next utterence chunk).
flite.unregisterVoice("stop"); //sets the global stopSpeaking variable to stop

//Allow speaking. Sets the stopSpeaking global variable to allow speaking
flite.allowSpeech("speak');
